# MDM-RoboticHand
## This project concerns the mechanical design and the actuation of a Robotic toy hand

Me and my collegue Lorenzo Baccelliere  modelled a toy robotic hand with the software CREO v8 as final project of the course of Modeling Design Methods.

## First Phase:

Since the number of pieces the hand was made up with were too many for a single couple to handle the whole amoount of work in such a brief period, the 3D modeling 
of all the parts was divided between the whole class of Robotic Engineering.

Having all the parts 3D modelled let us proceeding further by their assembly. By looking at the guide we assembled four fingers, the palm, the support structure and 
the pumps used to repliclate the real movement of the toy.
