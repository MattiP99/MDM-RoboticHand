# MDM-RoboticHand
## This project concerns the mechanical design and the actuation of a Robotic toy hand

Me and my collegue Lorenzo Baccelliere  modelled a toy robotic hand with the software CREO v8 as final project of the course of Modeling Design Methods.

---
## First Phase:
---

Since the time was strict and the number of pieces the hand was made of with was huge the whole 3D modeling of all the parts was divided between the whole class of Robotic Engineering. We had to handle the four pieces modeling

## Second Phase
---

Having all the parts 3D modelled let us proceed further with their assembly. We adopted a top-down mental initial approach. We divided the whole hand into sub parts and in their turn into other sub-parts until we arrived on having the single atomic components mentioned above.So we came up with the following main components: four fingers, the palm, the support structure and the pumps used to repliclate the real movement of the toy.

## Third Phase
---
The time to assemble the part was come and we adopted a bottom- up approach here:   
Starting from the components just modelled, we followed the logical path mentioned above but in reverse. Also following the guide provided to us, we chose the best joints and position definitions to have the cleanest and most linear code possible.

#Fourth Phase
---
In order to make the final product as similar as possible to the original, we decided, as a optional plus, to recreate the water movement of the pumps by actuating the end wires with motors. These, having been attached to the fingers by gears with specific gear ratios (we took into account the volume of water moved inside the pumps and the size of the pumps' outlet and inlet hole) recreated the movement of the fingers driven by that of a person wearing the toy.
